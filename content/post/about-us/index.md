# Foundation, Community, Team

We created a fund where finance is not the main resource. The main resource of the fund is time spent on interesting projects by rising stars, founders and the best specialists. Join us! If your idea is interesting, it will definitely be executed by the masters of their craft. And you can join the team of masters. We gather the community to solve any problems. And create products from any ideas. Many pet projects and interesting open source libraries stop being developed because the developer does not find time and interest in them. But when there are people with a different point of view or other style of thinking in the project, the project will develop for a long time and will be the best.

# Develop, Design, Start up

We assemble a distributed team of developers, designers and product owners. Our mission is to bring together standalone masters and startups to share experience, resources and expertise.

Join us to make the product you dreamed of with the perfect team.

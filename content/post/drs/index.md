### Drunken Snake?

Not so long ago, I completely switched from python to go. Despite the fact that I have reached to the senior.

I'm sure python has a great future as a language for college education and data science. Or for quick scripts and prototypes.

But I know how a python can surprise you. I made a channel with the most daring solutions in python.
